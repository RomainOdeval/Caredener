# Ansible Role: Nginx

## 
This Nginx Ansible Role is initiated with the wonderful [project](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-nginx/) of Jeff Geerling, under MIT License.
Otherwise, i don't want for my project to fork his work for many reasons, specially to not depends of Gerling project updates and positions (I know how forks work but it will be quite stupid if 2 projects will be too different, no ?).
In fact, i put paternity of initial code here and let this part of project code under MIT license.

## How it works
